# sonarqube-jenkins

SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous 
inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of 
code to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells on 17 programming languages.

In this project I'll show you how to integrate SonarQube in Jenkins CI/CD. I'll 
be using **petclinic** application forked from the following [repository](https://github.com/g0t4/jgsu-spring-petclinic)
